## 📈 Key Visualizations

1️⃣ **Yearly Trends by Severity**  
   - Line chart with slicer/parameter to switch between Fatal, Severe, Moderate, and Normal crimes.

2️⃣ **Top Crime-Prone States**  
   - Bar chart of top 10 states for total IPC crimes.

3️⃣ **Crime Severity Composition per State**  
   - Donut chart to show share of severity types.

4️⃣ **Crime Trends over Time**  
   - Multi-line chart for different crime types across states and districts.

5️⃣ **Crime Intensity Heatmap**  
   - Heatmap (Tableau) or Matrix (Power BI) showing state-wise crime volume variations by year.

## 🗂️ Techniques Used

- Filters: Year slicers, state filters, district buttons.
- Parameters & Slicers: For interactive crime type selection.
- Calculated Fields: Severity classification & dynamic titles.
- Heatmap and Forecasting: Tableau vs. Power BI implementation.

## ⚖️ Comparison

**Similarities:**  
✔️ Bar, line, donut charts, and map visuals supported.  
✔️ Calculated fields, drill-downs, tooltips, filters.  
✔️ Forecasting is native to Tableau, more setup needed in Power BI.

**Differences:**  
✅ Tableau is more intuitive for layout/storyboarding.  
✅ Power BI gives more control over dynamic visuals and conditional formatting.
